=======


Nested models:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Head1, Head2, Head3 are 3 nested spheres as head models, with ratio 0.87, 0.92 and 1.

Head1 model contains 42 vertices
Head2 model contains 162 vertices
Head3 model contains 642 vertices


NonNested models:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
HeadNNa1, HeadNNa2, HeadNNb1, HeadNNb2 are Non-Nested models.
HeadNNaX is HeadX, where the inner sphere is splitted into two hemispheres: north & south. ( with X={1,2})

HeadNNbX is HeadX, where in the inner sphere were added two little spheres of radius 0.3 with center at (0., +/-0.4, 0.): spherenorth & spheresouth. ( with X={1,2})
